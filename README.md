# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Financial-News(Graduation Project)
In this study, it is aimed to estimate BIST 100 index movements by using financial news. Here, BIST 100 indices are used based on daily closing values. The news and BIST 100 data set consists of data from 24 January 2011 to 7 February 2020. Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM) and multilayer artificial neural network (MLP) methods were used as classifiers in the prediction process. While using these methods, Word2Vec, FastText and TF-IDF models were used to create the feature vectors of news data. Performance evaluation was made with F-Score. Majority Voting was used to improve the F-Score obtained as a result of these classifications. It was observed that the F-Score obtained as a result of the majority voting were higher and the models gave more successful results. It was seen that the most successful result was given by the MLP model trained with TF-IDF vectors.
